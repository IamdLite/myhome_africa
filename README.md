# MyHome Africa v0.0

`MyHome Africa` is an open-source research and data collection system developed under the [NASA OLS Nebula-2024 Pilot Program](https://openlifesci.org/nasa/)

The Nebula program provides structured training covering the [NASA TOPS Open Science 101 Curriculum](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/Open-Science-101/readme.md). Every week for about 3 months, we explore open science modules, with expert speakers from diverse scientific domains with the aim of empowering learners to actively implement open science concepts and tools in their work.

## Mission and Vision

Our **mission** is to provide a platform for the African Diaspora to support and give back to their respective home communities. The aim is to reconcile African diaspora (scholars, professionals, adventurers) with their various fatherlands.

Our **vision** is to identify and create a vibrant and inclusive community of African talents residing in foreign countries, working together to address the continent's unique challenges and contribute to the development of their native countries.

The data collected from the platform helps us to derive insights from the _distribution of African scholars across foreign territories._ It's analysis will particularly be useful to Africans aspiring to `go abroad` in search of greener pastures--_academic, social or professional_--by helping them to make informed travel decisions and find supportive communities of 'their own'. **Governments** can equally leverage this data to strategise, retain or call back African talents.

Join us on this exciting journey towards a creating an open-source system for data-driven insights into African brain drain and Potential! You can get in touch with me at diffouo44@gmail.
